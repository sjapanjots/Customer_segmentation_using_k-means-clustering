# 🎯 Customer Segmentation using K‑Means Clustering

A machine learning solution that segments customers into distinguishable groups based on purchasing behavior and demographics using the K‑Means clustering algorithm.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project explores customer segmentation by applying unsupervised learning (K‑Means) to identify distinct customer groups. Such segmentation helps businesses optimize marketing, enhance product recommendations, and tailor customer engagement.

---

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **scikit-learn** – For feature scaling and K‑Means clustering
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – For data visualization and cluster analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For interactive development and documentation

---

## 📄 What's Inside

- `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`  
  Jupyter Notebook with complete EDA, preprocessing, clustering, and analysis.

- `data/` folder:  
  Holds CSV dataset(s) containing customer features (e.g., age, income, spending).

## 📊 Project Flow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   - Import dataset into a DataFrame  
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (statistical summary, distribution plots)

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values (if any)  
   - Scale numerical features using `StandardScaler`

3. **K‑Means Clustering**  
   - Use elbow method to determine optimal `k`  
   - Fit K‑Means and assign cluster labels

4. **Results Visualization**  
   - Use scatter plots with cluster colors to visualize segmentation  
   - Analyze cluster characteristics and profile each group

## 📥 How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sjapanjots/Customer_segmentation_using_k-means-clustering.git
   cd Customer_segmentation_using_k-means-clustering
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open and run `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` in your browser.

## ✅ How to Interpret Results

- Check the **elbow plot** to determine the ideal number of clusters.
- Visualize clusters (e.g., income vs spending) to understand group separation.
- Analyze cluster centroids to profile customer segments (e.g., “High-income low-spenders”).
